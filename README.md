# Diabetic-Prediction-Model
My first Github Project

**Introduction**
Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Early detection can help manage and even prevent the disease from developing further. This project applies supervised machine learning models to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic features such as blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, etc.

**Dataset**
The model is trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains:
768 samples (rows)
8 features (columns) including:
Pregnancies

Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
1 target column:
Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
